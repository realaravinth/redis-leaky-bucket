## Features

- [x] Timers for individual count
- [x] Clustering
- [x] Persistence through RDB
- [ ] Persistence through AOF

## Motivation

[mCaptcha](https://github.com/mCaptcha/mCaptcha) uses a [leaky-
bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket)-enabled counter to
keep track of traffic/challenge requests.

- At `t=0`(where `t` is time), if someone is visiting an mCaptcha-protected website, the
  counter for that website will be initialized and set to 1.

- It should also automatically decrement(by 1) after a certain period, say
  `t=cooldown`. I call this cool down period and is constant for a
  website.

- If at `t=x`(where `x<cooldown`), another user visits the same website,
  the counter becomes 2 and will auto decrement at `t = cooldown + x`
  for second user.

  Note that, for the decrement to work, we require two different timers
  that goes off at two different instants. The current(`v0.1.3`) of
  [`libmcaptcha`](https://github.com/mCaptcha/libmcaptcha/) implements
  this with internal data structures and timers --- something that can't
  be shared across several machines in a distributed setting.

  So we figured we'd use Redis to solve this problem and get
  synchronisation and persistence for free.

  This Redis module implements auto decrement on a special
  data type(which is also defined in this module).

## How does it work?

If a timer is supposed to go off to
decrement key `myCounter` at `t=y`(where y is an instant in future),

1. A hashmap called `lbucket:bucket:y`(prefix might vary) is
   created with key-value pairs `keyName: DecrementCount`(`myCounter: 1` in
   our case)

2. A timer will be created to go off at `t=y`

3. Any further decrement operations that are scheduled for `t=y` are
   registered with the same hashmap(`lbucket:bucket:y`).

4. At `t=y`, a procedure will be executed to read
   all values of the hashmap(`lbucket:bucket:y`) and performs
   all registered decrements. When its done, it cleans itself up.

This way, we are not spinning timers for every decrement operation but
instead, one for every "bucket".

### Gotchas:

This module creates and manages data of three types:

1.  `lbucket:captcha:y` where `y`(last character) is variable
2.  `lbucket:bucket:x` where `x`(last character) is variable
3.  `lbucket:timer:z` where `z`(last character) is bucket name from
    step 2(See [Hacks](#hacks)).

**WARNING: Please don't modify these manually. If you do so, then Redis
will panic**

This module is capable of cleaning up after itself so manual clean up is
unnecessary. If you have needs that are not met my this module and you
which access/mutate data manually, please open an
[issue](https://github.com/realaravinth/redis-leaky-bucket/issues). I'd be happy to help.

## Usage

There are two ways to run `cache`:

1. [Using docker](#docker)
2. [On bare-metal](#bare-metal)

### Docker

Use image from DockerHub:

```bash
$  docker run -p 6379:6379 realaravinth/redis-leaky-bucket
```

or build from source:

#### Build

```bash
$ docker build -t realaravinth/redis-leaky-bucket .
```

#### Run

```bash
$  docker run -p 6379:6379  realaravinth/redis-leaky-bucket
```

### Bare-metal

#### Build

Make sure you have Rust installed:
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Then, build as usual:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

#### Run

```
redis-server --loadmodule ./target/release/liblbucket.so
```

### Commands

Every counter has a name and a leak-rate in seconds.

## Create/Increment counter

If counter exists, then count is incremented. Otherwise, it is created.

```redis
LBUCKET.COUNT <counter-name> <leak-rate-in-seconds>
```

## Get counter value

```redis
LBUCKET.GET <counter-name>
```

## Benchmark

**NOTE:** These benchmarks are for reference only. Do not depend upon
them too much. When in doubt, please craft and run benchmarks that are
better suited to your workload.

To run benchmarks locally, launch Redis server with module loaded and:

```bash
$ ./scripts/bench.sh
```

- platform: `Intel core i7-9750h`

```bash
running set and get without pipelining
SET: 125046.89 requests per second, p50=0.199 msec
GET: 124502.00 requests per second, p50=0.199 msec

mCaptcha cache without piplining
MCAPTCHA_CACHE.COUNT mycounter 45: 124828.37 requests per second, p50=0.215 msec

running set and get with pipelining
SET: 1353179.88 requests per second, p50=0.487 msec
GET: 1633987.00 requests per second, p50=0.383 msec

mCaptcha cache with piplining
MCAPTCHA_CACHE.COUNT mycounter 45: 385653.69 requests per second, p50=1.959 msec
```

## Hacks

I couldn't find any ways to persist timers to disk(`RDB`/`AOF`). So I'm
using a dummy record(`lbucket:timer:*` see [Gotchas](#gotchas)) which
will expire after an arbitrary time(see `BUCKET_EXPIRY_OFFSET` in
[`lib.rs`](./src/lib.rs)). When that expiry occurs, I derive the key of
the bucket from the values that are passed to expiration event handlers
and perform clean up of both the bucket and counters registered with the
bucket.

Ideally, I should be able to persist timers but I couldn't find ways to
do that.
